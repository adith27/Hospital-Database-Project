# Hospital Database Project
A relational database made using MySQL that performs symptom-based patient scheduling and other complex tasks

**What can you expect in the future?** <br/>
I have currently set this project to private since I'm still in the research & planning stage. I am working on an ER model for the database at the moment as well as determining the possible needs of the database. I will be making this project public once I am halfway through the development stage.
