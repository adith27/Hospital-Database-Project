# Hospital Database Project
Hospital Management Database: The purpose of this database is to keep record of hospital data. The hospital needs to assign nurses to provide in-home care or specify that patients want/need transportation to the hospital (if it's immediate or not). The hospital also needs to assign employees (doctors/nurses) and patients to appointments based off of the ailment of the patient. The hospital will also be able to sell medicine that is prescribed in an appointment that is available in store. This will be accomplished by querying based on data like: nurseâ€™s licenses (in order to provide in home care or emergency transportation), ailments (certain ailments would automatically reduce search to specific departments, etc.), doctor specialty (doctors belong to certain department), fulfilling prescriptions, etc.
